# Cyclistic
Google Data Analytics Capstone

# Introduction

Hello, my name is Andrew and I am an aspiring Data Analyst. I am completing the Google Data Analytics Certification course as my first step in my Data Analytics career. I am hoping that I can use my drive and passion for technology and data to learn and grow my analysis skills. I have experience working with large databases and am looking forward to see how I can implement those skills into analyzing data. This notebook will cover my first Data Analyst case study. The data was provided through the certification course and was cleaned/processed using R Studio. Afer analyzing the data, I created some visualizations using Tableau.

# Background Information

Cyclistic is a bike sharing program that began in 2016 and has rapidly expanded to include over 5,800 bikes and 600 docking stations. What sets Cyclistic apart is its dedication to inclusivity, offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes to cater to individuals with disabilities or those who cannot use traditional two-wheeled bikes.

The bikes in the fleet are equipped with geotracking technology and are connected to a network of 692 stations spread throughout Chicago. This interconnected system allows users to unlock bikes from one station and return them to any other station within the network at their convenience.

Previously, Cyclistic's marketing strategy focused on raising overall awareness and appealing to a wide range of consumers. They offer flexible pricing plans, including single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Casual riders opt for single-ride or full-day passes, while those who choose annual memberships become official Cyclistic members.

# ASK

My primary objective as a data analyst is to show how Cyclistic can optimize the number of annual memberships by converting casual customers (single-ride and day passes) into long-term members (annual membership). To achieve this, our data analysis will focus on discerning the distinct usage patterns between casual riders and annual members of Cyclistic bikes.

# Prepare

The RStudio packages that I am going to be utilizing are tidyverse, lubridate, janitor, hms, and scales. The Tidyverse, lubridate, and ggplot2 packages were covered in the Google Data Analytics course, but I wanted to explore a few new packages, so I made sure to take advantage of janitor for cleaning, hms for formatting dates, and scales for setting the scale to look better on the RStudio plots.
